The anaconda-installclass-goose application is simply an addin to anaconda.
This single python file provides tooling specific to the way we present
tasks within anaconda during an installation. 

This python class overrides the upstream definitions of tasks with the 
definitions provided by the GoOSe Project. 

Simply put, install this python file in the same location as the anaconda 
python files, run pungi against the system and you'll get the goose.py
options instead of the upstream or 'Minimal' task options.
